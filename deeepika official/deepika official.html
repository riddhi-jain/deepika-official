<i>At the peak of her career in 2014, Deepika Padukone started feeling low, empty and directionless. She experienced a sick, pit-ish feeling 
in her stomach for days on end. On seeking help from mental health professionals, she was diagnosed with depression and soon after, began treatment.
While researching her own illness she was exposed to two stark realities –  Mental illness was a taboo topic in India like elsewhere in the world,  and the lack of information and stigma associated with mental illness made it difficult for those who are suffering to seek the help they need. She sought to change this.
On New Year’s Day 2015, she decided to go public with her struggle in the hope that this would encourage others who were suffering to come out and seek help.
 Six months later ‘The Live Love Laugh Foundation’ (TLLLF) was set up.</i>
The main objective of TLLLF is to create awareness around stress, anxiety and depression, as well as to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness.
